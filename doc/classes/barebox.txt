Barebox Class
=============

The barebox class is used for integration of the Barebox bootloader in OE-lite
BSP projects.

The following USE flags are offered by the barebox class:

* USE_barebox_defconfig
* USE_barebox_maxsize

These USE flags are typically set in the machine configuration file, fx.
conf/machine/myboard.conf

----
MACHINE_USE_barebox_defconfig = "file"
MACHINE_USE_barebox_maxsize = "261124"
----

There are 3 different ways to configure a barebox recipe in OE-lite.

1. If the USE_barebox_defconfig flag is not set (the default), the barebox
   recipe will depend on a barebox-defconfig package.  This can fx. be used to
   use a standard/upstream barebox recipe but with a board specific custom
   configuration maintained in a project specific recipe.

2. If the USE_barebox_defconfig flag is set to "file", the barebox recipe
   should include a defconfig file itself.  This can be used in custom barebox
   recipes, where the configuration is hosted in OE-lite instead of in the
   barebox source.

3. Anything else will be assume to be a valid xxxxx_defconfig value to give to
   make to configure using the barebox source.

The USE_barebox_maxsize flag can be used to specify a maximum allowed size of
the barebox image file (in bytes).

Integration of Barebox development in a project specific barebox.git
repository is done by adding a new barebox recipe in the project specific
OE-lite recipes directory, fx. project-barebox.oe:

----
DESCRIPTION = "Project specific Barebox bootloader"
inherit barebox
SRC_URI = "git://...../barebox.git"
