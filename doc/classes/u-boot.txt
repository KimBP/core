U-Boot Class
============

The u-boot class is used for integration of Das U-Boot bootloader in OE-lite
BSP projects.

The following USE flags are offered by the u-boot class:

* USE_uboot_config
* USE_uboot_extra_env (requires USE_uboot_config_file)
* USE_uboot_config_file
* USE_uboot_maxsize

These USE flags are typically set in the machine configuration file, fx.
conf/machine/myboard.conf

----
MACHINE_USE_uboot_config = "myboard_config"
MACHINE_USE_uboot_maxsize = "261124"
----

The USE_uboot_config flag is the argument given to make to configure
for the (MACHINE specific) board.

Fx.

----
make foo_bar_config
----

is achieved by setting USE_uboot_config to "foo_bar_config"

This of-course requires that the U-Boot source code has support for
the given board configuration.

The USE_uboot_extra_env flag is used to modify (append to)
CONFIG_EXTRA_ENV_SETTINGS macro in the U-Boot configuration header file.
The header file is specified by the USE_uboot_config_file flag.

The USE_uboot_maxsize flag can be used to specify a maximum allowed size of
the U-Boot image file (in bytes).

The output from the U-Boot recipe is both a u-boot.bin and an ELF u-boot file.

For BSP's requiring a different type of image file, the U-Boot recipe is
either extended to support that, or a new recipe for the image file is created
which RDEPENDS on one of the packages from the U-Boot recipe.

Integration of Barebox development in a project specific barebox.git
repository is done by adding a new barebox recipe in the project specific
OE-lite recipes directory, fx. project-barebox.oe:

----
DESCRIPTION = "Project specific U-Boot bootloader"
inherit u-boot
SRC_URI = "git://...../u-boot.git"
----
