Libraries
=========

Information related to libraries build in OE-lite.

General Info
------------

Nothing OE-lite specific in here.

If a library is as follows:
libfoo.so.2.55.2
It consists of the following elements:

* Library name if libfoo
* Library version is 2.
* Library minor version is 55.
* Library release version is 2.

The minor version and release version is not mandatory.

Packaging in OE-lite
--------------------

When building a library, two classes may be used:

* library.oeclass - Use if recipe provides a single library.
* auto-package-libs.oeclass - use if recipe provides multiple recipes.

If the recipe is providing a single library, libbar, and the recipe is named foobar_0.1.oe, the recipe may be extended to create the correct packaging by:
inherit library
LIBRARY_NAME = "libbar"

If the recipe is providing multiple libraries, libfoo, libbar, and the recipe is named foobar_0.1.oe, the recipe may be extended to create the correct packaging by:
inherit auto-package-utils
AUTO_PACKAGE_LIBS = "foo bar"

If having a recipe building a single library, the name of the package containing the library will be PN.
If having a recipe building multiple libraries, the name of the packages will be PN-lib<libname>.

Packages containing a library, provides: lib<library name> and lib<library name>-<library version>. See examples below.
