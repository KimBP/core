Using prebaked packages
=======================

This section describes how to use packages build on another machine
available via http.


First you need to setup a http server that serves the prebaked packages
from another machine. The baked prebakes will be in `${TMPDIR}/packages`
so setup the  server to make files available online as you prefer.

Secondly, you need to set PREBAKE_URL to point to your prebaked packages url
prefix e.g: PREBAKE_CACHE_DIR can be set to pin point where the fetched
prebaked packages are located

----
#cat conf/site.conf
PREBAKE_URL="http://myserver.com/packages/"
PREBAKE_CACHE_DIR="<path-to-temp-storage>"
----

Note, that the directory structure under "packages" should match the
structure under `${TMPDIR}/packages`.

Presently, 32-bit machines should bake prebaked packages that should be
used on 32-bit machines as well (and likewise for 64-bit).

The feature has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 so please report a bug if you find
problems using this feature.
