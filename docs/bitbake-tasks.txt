files.bbclass:

Can be either be used "alone" in recipes to collect multiple target packages into bigger packages, or inherited in fx. a jffs2_image.bbclass recipe.

do_files_install
	installs all (exploded) RDEPENDS machine sysroot packages into
	WORKDIR/files.
	some tricks will be required to support RDEPENDS on other
	files packages, as their RDEPENDS should ofcourse not be
	exploded again.
	maybe we could use the recipe 'RDEPENDS' variable for
	specifying what to istall into files, and then use the package
	specific RDEPENDS_* variables for specifying additional
	depends

do_files_fixup
	do any last-minute fixup of the WORKDIR/files dir

do_files_package
	build machine sysroot packages.	
	normally just one packages (PN), but support for splitting
	into additional packages should be provided to allow something
	like splitting /var into a seperate filesystem.

"somefs"_images.bbclass

Build jffs2/ext2/ext3/cramfs/squashfs/ubifs/.... images from a files
collection.  Expected usage is to inherit files.bbclass and RDEPENDS
on one or more files.bbclass genereated package.  But nothing prevents
adding additional normal machine sysroot packages also.

do_image_build
	build image file(s) into WORKDIR/images.
	it can use both WORKDIR/stage and WORKDIR/files for doing this!

do_image_deploy
	install image file(s) from WORKDIR/images into DEPLOY_DIR
